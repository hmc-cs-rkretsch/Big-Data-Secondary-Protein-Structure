Final Project
Accuracy of algorithms for predicting secondary protein structure

Many of the methods first change the amino acid sequence. Essentially, they are trying to model post-transcriptional modifications. Given enough time I may try and introduce a modification method, but this is not as interesting for big data purposes. So I will assume that no modification has occured, and try to identify the secondary structure despite the fact the fact that I am ignoring modficiations.

Most methods are publicly availble. For my project, I want to take the principles these methods used and implement them myself. I will then compare the accuracy and efficieny of the methods. Implementing them myself will first be a great learing expierence, and second allow me to compare them more fairly as the implementation will be more uniform.

I have broken this project into steps:
1) Collect data, amino acid sequences (also need to find a good group of proteins to test)
2) Study the methods used and understand the math behind it (essentially this will give me psuedocode)
3) Implement the methods
4) Test the implementation
The goals is to have the first two done by the midterm and the second two to do after. There is a chance that I will not be able to implement and test all methods which is likely, but I would like to have a least 2 working. I would still like to have the mathematical understanding behind all of them though.

I have collected sequence data from the protein data bank.
